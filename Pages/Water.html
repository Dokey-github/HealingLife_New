    <h3>Water</h3>

    <div>
        <article class="Description">

            Water (chemical formula H2O) is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless
            chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living
            organisms (in which it acts as a solvent[1]). It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it
            provides no calories or organic nutrients. Its chemical formula H2O, indicates that each of its molecules
            contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to
            the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°.[2] "Water" is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard
            conditions for temperature and pressure.

            A number of natural states of water exist. It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the
            form of fog. Clouds consist of suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state. When finely divided,
            crystalline ice may precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor.
