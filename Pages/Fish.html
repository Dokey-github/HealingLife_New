    <h3>Fish</h3>

    <div>
        <article class="Description">

            Fish are aquatic, craniate, gill-bearing animals that lack limbs with digits.
            Included in this definition are the living hagfish, lampreys,
            and cartilaginous and bony fish as well as various extinct related groups.
            Around 99% of living fish species are ray-finned fish, belonging to the class Actinopterygii,
            with over 95% belonging to the teleost subgrouping.

            The earliest organisms that can be classified as fish were soft-bodied chordates that first appeared during
            the Cambrian period.
            Although they lacked a true spine, they possessed notochords which allowed them to be more agile than their
            invertebrate counterparts.
            Fish would continue to evolve through the Paleozoic era, diversifying into a wide variety of forms.
            Many fish of the Paleozoic developed external armor that protected them from predators.
            The first fish with jaws appeared in the Silurian period, after which many (such as sharks) became
            formidable marine predators rather than just the prey of arthropods.
